#Lab Exercise Six

##Problem Set 1
1) 
> length(DataPBDB$occurrence_no)-length(MacroPBDB$occurrence_no)

> [1] 25153

2) By default, because Macrostrat is only in North America currently, any occurrence outside of North America is dropped in the matching procedure. 

##Problem Set 2
1)
> CandidateUnits <- c(as.character(arrange(order_rich, desc(richness))[1:10,]$names))

> CandidateUnits

> [1] "Chancellor"       "Kinzers Fm"       "Stephen Fm"       "Marjum Limestone"

> [5] "Wheeler Shale"    "Langston Fm"      "Parker Slate"     "Snowy Range Fm"  

> [9] "Weymouth Fm"      "Harkless Fm"

2)
> GenusFrequencies <- data.frame(genus_frequencies=apply(GenusMatrix, 2, sum))

3) 
> hist(GenusFrequencies)

4) Hollow curves!

5) 
> RareGenera <- subset(GenusFrequencies, genus_frequencies<=median(genus_frequencies))
