###Part one
1) I feel that it was both sufficiently long and demonstrated a genuine effort on her part for the purposes of the peer review.

2) Stellar Sea lions...

3)

4) For the most part, the only thing that needed significant improvement was the justification section and addition to it. Smaller things might include more sources and additional work on the methods. 

5) The idea was clearly stated, but it did need more extensive elaboration. 

6) Only four sources were used if I remember correctly. So more than just increased incorporation within the text, she will need to do more extensive research.

###Part two
1) She understood it, but two of her points were (1) that I should make the hypothesis more explicit and (2) incorporate habitat fragmentation (mentioned in the justification/research plan) into it. Although I saw the need to do the second, I instead pulled it out of the proposal because Val also mentioned being thrown by the addition of it. It seems to flow better without it. With regard to (1), I did change it to an explicit 'I hypothesize' statement for clarity.

2) Relavency didn't play that big of a role in her review, so I am assuming there were no qualms with it.

###Part one
1) 

2) Her hypothesis was that relatively short magnetic pole switches adversely affected migratory species.

3) While some investigation has been done into the ecological effects of magnetic reversal, as far as I know very few have dealt with their duration. Although I think that may have something to do with the availability of data. 

4) I noticed that the citations were not present in the text (although they were not absent from the draft), and that the research plan was lacking specific methodology. Also, similar to Leema, I felt that more sources could have been found in general.

5) I suggested that she focus on one clade of migratory species, such as birds, instead of three separate ones.

6)

###Part two
1) It was suggested I make it a little clearer, just as with Leema. But other than that, nothing else.

2) Again, she seemed to be implicitly okay with the relavency as it was not really mentioned.

3) She suggested I develop an actual plan for analysis, as I only really mentioned how to put the data together. And as to the data construction itself she thought it would be relavent to the proposed project. She also suggested I put more justification in as to why MATLAB should be used, but I feel that anyone remotely familiar with R will know that it isn't conducive to calculus.
