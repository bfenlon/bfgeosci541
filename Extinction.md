#Determinants of extinction in the fossil record
###Shanan E. Peters and Michael Foote (2002)
#####Written by Bryce Fenlon

##Summary
Key to investigations of the rock record are correlations between the availability of rock and events percieved by paleobiologists. More specifically, extinction and the corresponding loss of biodiversity in the fossil record are of interest in that they provide an ideal situation to test both model and prediction accuracy. By modeling the relationship between instantaneous preservation and extinction rates among 77 Phanerozoic stages, Peters and Foote evaluate the relationship between percieved extinction and availability of sedimentary rock.
