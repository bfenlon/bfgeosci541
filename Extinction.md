##Summary
Key to investigations of the rock record are correlations between the availability of rock and events percieved by paleobiologists. More specifically, extinction and the corresponding loss of biodiversity in the fossil record are of interest in that they provide an ideal set of data to test both model and prediction accuracy. Following from this, extinctions in the rock record often occur because of poor preservation in the subsequent stage, leading to an artificially inflated rate of extinction in the stage with these "last" occurrences. The converse is also true, stages with exceptional preservational characteristics are often preceded by artificially low extinction rates because they were able to capture a proportionally higher amount of "true" extinctions. The cumulative effect of these spurious occurrences is an offset introduced to predictions of preservation potential based on rock availability. By comparing the relationship between instantaneous extinction rates by stage and their updated estimate of exposed marine sedimentary rock, Peters and Foote were able to show that change in the observed extinction rate (per genus per million years) correlated to the change in the number of exposed formations (r=0.238, P=0.056). Moreover, when a time lag of one stage was introduced to account for the previously explained offset, the correlation became much stronger and the significance much greater (r=-0.471, P<0.0001). However, to more fully explain the relationship of the amount of rock to extinction rate it was necesary to use a model which assumed that departures from smooth variations in observed extinction rates throughout the fossil record are at least partly due to heterogeneity in the process of preservation. In order to test the significance of this model, two null distributions were drawn from 2000 model-data correlation coefficients based on either constant extinction rates and stage lengths or on declining extinction rates and variable stage lengths. The observed correlation coefficients were completely outside of both of these null distributions (P<0.0005), indicating that the model is able to predict variation in extinction rate - based on the amount of exposed rock - with statistical significance.
