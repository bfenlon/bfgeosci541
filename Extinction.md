##Summary
Key to investigations of the rock record are correlations between the availability of rock and events percieved by paleobiologists. More specifically, extinction and the corresponding loss of biodiversity in the fossil record are of interest in that they provide an ideal set of data to test both model and prediction accuracy. Following from this, false or spurious extinctions in the rock record often occur because of poor preservation in the subsequent stage, leading to an artificially inflated rate of extinction in the stage with these "last" occurrences. The converse is also true, stages with exceptional preservation characteristics are often preceded by artificially low extinction rates. By comparing the relationship between instantaneous extinction rates by stage and their estimate of exposed marine sedimentary rock, Peters and Foote were able to show that change in the observed extinction rate (per genus per million years) correlated to the change in the number of exposed formations (r=0.238, P=0.056). Moreover, when a time lag of one stage was introduced to account for the offset introduced to the extinction rate by preservation, the correlation became much stronger and the significance much greater (r=-0.471, P<0.0001).
