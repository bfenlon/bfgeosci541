#The migration of paleocontinents
###Problem set 1
1) Modern North America is West of its Cretaceous position.

2) This code is plotting ModernMap and adding it (```add=TRUE```) to an existing plot. The ```col``` argument takes a color specification (in this case an rgb value for red, at an opacity of 0.33), ```lty``` takes any one of a number of line types specified by an integer, and the ```add``` argument, as mentioned already, adds to a preexisting plot without creating an entirely new one.

3)```AlbianMap <- downloadPaleogeography(Age=110)```

4) ```plot(AlbianMap, col=rgb(0,1,0,0.33), lty=0, add=TRUE)```

5) In the Eastern Hemisphere, more movement North and South than East and West is visible.

6) In the Western Hemisphere, more Westward movement is visible than Northern and Southern movement.

###Problem set 2
1)
```
PalEo <- downloadPaleogeography(Age=56)
plot(PalEo, col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5), lty=0)
```

```
Anthozoa <- downloadPBDB("Anthozoa", StartInterval="Paleocene", StopInterval="Eocene")
```
3) 2,847 occurrences were downloaded.

4) There are 26 columns. Occurrence number has an obvious meaning, it merely references the corresponding occurrence for each observation of the 25 remaining variables. Record type is the type of observation being returned, and in every observation of this data frame it has the value of occurrence (occ). ```reid_no``` denotes the reidentification column, and only contains a value if the occurrence was reidentified at some point. ```flags``` will only have a value (of R) if there is a more recent identification of the occurrence, and it will be empty for most. ```collection_no``` tells us what collection each occurrence belongs to. ```accepted_name```,  ```accepted_rank```, and ```accepted_no``` differ from ```identified_name```, ```identified_rank```, and ```identified_no``` only in that identified categories may be of a dubious or ambiguous nature. the ```difference``` column provides the reasons for any disparity between them. If ```late_interval``` is also given, ```early_interval``` corresponds to the beginning of the geologic time range of the occurrence. If ```late_interval``` is not present, it just means the geologic time range and not the beginning of the range. ```max_ma``` and ```min_ma``` correspond to the early and late bounds, respectively, of the geologic time range of the occurrence in millions of years. ```reference_no``` identifies what reference the occurrence comes from. ```paleolat``` and ```paleolng``` give comtemporaneous values for latitude and longitude, respectively, drawn from a specific ```paleomodel```. ```geoplate``` defines a region of the world from which each occurrence originates. Finally, ```phylum```, ```class```, ```order```, ```family```, and ```genus``` give the taxonomical hierarchy designations for each occurrence. 

5)
```
points(Anthozoa$paleolng, Anthozoa$paleolat, col="red", cex=0.2)
```
6) In the Eastern Hemisphere, Anthozoa occur mainly in what is modern Europe. Furthermore, although they appear to be on land Anthozoans are primarily marine organisms. This would lead me to conclude that there must have been epicontinental seas at these locations at this specific point in history. 

###Problem set 3
1)```Perisso <- downloadPBDB("Perissodactyla", StartInterval="Paleocene", StopInterval="Oligocene")```

2) Members of Perissodactyla are colloquially known as odd-toed ungulates. They include modern members of Equidae, Rhinocerotidae, and Tapiridae. Specific examples would include the eight living species of horses and zebras and the (mostly endangered) five species of rhino.

3)```Perisso[which(Perisso$collection_no == 112723),]```

4) 501. This geoplate's modern day region is the Indian subcontinent, probably close to the Himalayas.

5) 
```
Perisso2 <- Perisso[which(Perisso$geoplate == 501),]
length(Perisso2)
[1] 26
```

6) Region-X was originally south of what we know as Africa (although it was rotated clockwise from its current orientation; region-X was actually south of modern Somalia and Kenya), and it moved northward until it "slammed" into the modern continent of Asia. 

7) By using the Paleobiology Database it is plain to see, when looking at successive stages, that with regards to the first two scenarios Perissodactyla migrated from China to region-X during the Paleogene. The third is half wrong, the occurrences in China and region-X are not unrelated, but it does appear to be the case that Perissodactyla originated in what is now North America and subsequently migrated to China and then to region-X.
