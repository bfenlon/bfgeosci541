#The migration of paleocontinents
###Problem set 1
1) Modern North America is West of its Cretaceous position.

2) This code is plotting ModernMap and adding it (```add=TRUE```) to an existing plot. The ```col``` argument takes a color specification (in this case an rgb value for red, at an opacity of 0.33), ```lty``` takes any one of a number of line types specified by an integer, and the ```add``` argument, as mentioned already, adds to a preexisting plot without creating an entirely new one.

3)```AlbianMap <- downloadPaleogeography(Age=110)```

4) ```plot(AlbianMap, col=rgb(0,1,0,0.33), lty=0, add=TRUE)```

5) In the Eastern Hemisphere, more movement North and South than East and West is visible.

6) In the Western Hemisphere, more Westward movement is visible than Northern and Southern movement.
