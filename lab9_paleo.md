#The migration of paleocontinents
###Problem set 1
1) Modern North America is West of its Cretaceous position.
2) This code is plotting ModernMap and adding it (```add=TRUE```) to an existing plot. The ```col``` argument takes a color specification (in this case an rgb value for red, at an opacity of 0.33), ```lty``` takes any one of a number of line types specified by an integer, and the ```add``` argument, as mentioned already, adds to a preexisting plot without creating an entirely new one.
3)  ```AlbianMap <- downloadPaleogeography(Age=110)```
