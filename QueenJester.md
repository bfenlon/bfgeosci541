#The Red Queen and the Court Jester: Species Diversity and the Role of Biotic and Abiotic Factors Through Time
###Michael J. Benton (2009)
#####Written by Bryce Fenlon
##Summary
Evolution, depending on who you talk to, can be viewed either through the lense of the Court Jester hypothesis or the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen model emphasizes the role of competition, predation, and biotic factors in general; intrinsic characteristics. On the other hand, the Court Jester model focuses on the role of extrinsic conditions such as climate and tectonics when looking at evolution. Furthermore, biotic pressures act on species diversity across relatively short timescales (up to 100,000 years) and external factors play a more important role across larger scales.
