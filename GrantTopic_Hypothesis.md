##Introduction
Explanations of global trilobite biodiversity decline range from active displacement by brachiopod dominated environments to paleocontinental movement and its differing effects on various taxonomic ranks (Harper et al 2015; Westrop and Adrain 2001). These include change in the depth of seas, freshwater circulation, and ocean flux patterns (DeVries and Primeau 2011; Balseiro and Waisfeld 2013). All of them are documented to some extent. Yet their individual effects on biodiversity are inherently difficult to determine due to convolution. **Trilobite familial abundance decline between the Cambrian and Ordovician was strongly influenced by brachiopod radiation. By using geoplate and paleocoordinate data, deconvolution of trilobite and brachiopod family richness can be performed and subsequent correspondence analysis on geoplate presence matrices for both phyla can be run. The main goal is to minimize objective paleocontinental movement when analyzing correspondence.**
