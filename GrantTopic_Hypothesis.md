###Introduction
(839 of 1000)
Explanations of global trilobite biodiversity decline range from active displacement by brachiopod dominated environments to paleocontinental movement and its differing effects on various taxonomic ranks (Harper et al 2015; Westrop and Adrain 2001). These include change in the depth of seas, freshwater circulation, and ocean flux patterns (DeVries and Primeau 2011; Balseiro and Waisfeld 2013). Regardless of these potentially confounding effects, trilobite familial abundance change over the Proteozoic was strongly linked to the rate of contemporaneous brachiopod radiation. Primarily through the use of paleocoordinate data, modeling inward (establishment) or outward (extirpation) familial flux by geoplate between epochs will be possible. A secondary goal will be to extend Jackson and Sax’s 2010 paper on delayed extinction debts and immigration credits to the analysis of geoplate flux. 

###Justification

maybe
```
flux through orientable surfaces defined at each epoch by the planar distributions of brachiopod and trilobite first differences...
  hard to do in R
  MATLAB?
  thickness defined by rock package thickness might be possible but data and time intensive
  or surfaces defined by paleocontinent shape/position relying on paleo maps created for each stage in R
 ```
 ```
Emigration vs immigration effects on biodiversity change
  Tabulate adjacent geoplates by stage; find outward/inward flux for each geoplate between stages
  Could limit to brachiopods/trilobites
  We already know that immigration/emigration is inherently related to biodiversity, but conceivably one is more influential than the   other

 ```
 ```
Does circulation of species in fossil record (simulation Andrew showed us) around continents over geologic time correspond to continental/tectonic circulation rates
 ```
 ```
 Extend Jackson and Sax 2010 to delayed extinction debt and immigration credit to brachiopod geoplate flux by stage, with the strength of the forcing events as amount of introduction/extirpation of trilobites to a specific plate (i.e. nonzero, positive or negative trilobite species flux since previous stage)
