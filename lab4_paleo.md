#Lab Exercise Four

##Section one
1. Miocene=603, Early Jurassic=169, Late Cretaceous=375, Pennsylvanian=133
  > sum(PresencePBDB["Miocene",])

2. There are 29 epochs in this data set. 
  > str(PresencePBDB)

3. *Mytilus* is present in the Pridoli, Early Devonian, Cisuralian, Late Jurassic, Eocene, Late Cretaceous, Early Cretaceous, Middle Jurassic, Paleocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Early Jurassic, Pleistocene, Middle Triassic, Pliocene, and Early Triassic epochs. 
  > which(PresencePBDB[,"Mytilus"]==1)

4. We can infer from 3 that *Mytilus* was present in the Mississippian, Middle Devonian, Late Devonian, Guadalupian, and Lopingian epochs.

##Section two
1. jacsim(PresencePBDB) = 0.8279221
  
  > library(dplyr)

  > jacsim <- function(x) {

  > jac1 <- data.frame(Pleistocene=x["Pleistocene",],Miocene=x["Miocene",])
  
  > jac2 <- mutate(.data=jac1, sums=rowSums(jac1))
  
  > a <- ifelse(jac2[,"sums"]==2,TRUE,ifelse(jac2[,"sums"]==1,FALSE,ifelse(jac2[,"sums"]==0,NA,NA)))
  
  > b <- length(which(a))
  
  > c <- length(which(a==FALSE))
  
  > d <- b/(b+c)
  
  > return(d)
  
  > }
  
  
2. 1.0-0.8279221=0.1720779

3.
  > vegdist(PresencePBDB[c("Pleistocene","Miocene"),], method="jaccard")

4.
  > vegdist(PresencePBDB[c("Pleistocene","Pliocene","Miocene","Oligocene","Eocene",

  > "Paleocene"),], method="jaccard")
  
##Section three
1.
  > RandomEpochs <- PresencePBDB[c("Pliocene","Oligocene","Paleocene","Early Cretaceous","Late Jurassic","Middle Jurassic"),]

2.
  > vegdist(RandomEpochs, method="jaccard")
3. Middle Jurassic, Late Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, Paleocene, Oligocene, Pliocene

4. Although no singular variable determines the boundaries of epochs in geologic time, temperature seems to be the driving force behind much of the similarities/differences between them. Geographic distance due to the breakup of Gondwana in the Cretaceous may have accelerated temperature change by altering ocean currents.

5. The defining boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleocene is the K-Pg mass extinction event. In the Early Cretaceous, ecological niches were filled with quite a different variety of creatures than in the Paleocene, simply due to adaptive radiation and speciation after the non-avian dinosaurs lost their battle with entropy.

##Section four
1.
  > Ordovician <- downloadPBDB(Taxa="animalia",StartInterval="Ordovician",StopInterval="")

2.
  > Ordovician <- cleanGenus(Ordovician)

3.
  > Ordovician <- cullMatrix(PresencePBDB,minOccurrences=2,minDiversity=25)
  

4. I looked at the summaries of samples drawn (without replacement) from both the "paleolat" and "paleolng" categories in the Ordovician data set. Because the latitude distribution is constrained more due to latitudinal tolerances of organisms, it would seem to make sense that the DCA2 axis would relate to the latitude, and the DCA1 axis with its relatively random distribution density would relate to longitude in the downloaded data.

  > distlng <- sample(Ordovician[,"paleolng"],replace=FALSE)
  
  > distlat <- sample(Ordovician[,"paleolat"],replace=FALSE)

  > summary(distlng)
  
  > summary(distlat)
