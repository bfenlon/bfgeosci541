Cenozoic latitudinal response curves: individualistic changes in the latitudinal distributions of marine bivalves and gastropods
By Andrew A. Zaffos and Arnold I. Miller

Summary
The goal of this paper was to determine the efficacy of previous research postulating poleward expansion of marine bivalve and gastropod genera during the Cenozoic era. Four central questions were posed and answered in the article. Firstly, the researchers investigated the overarching question of whether or not an observable pattern of migration actually exists. Through Guassian logistic regression, Zaffos and Miller estimated preferred latitude and latitudinal tolerance parameters for each genus across Cenozoic time intervals (both stages and epochs). Contingent upon these parameters is whether or not the changes observed correlate with the reconstructed latitudinal gradient for genus distribution, and a bootstrapping procedure which compared 1000 reshuffled response curve parameter comparisons across genera was used for this purpose. For all that statistical work (magic?), the conclusion drawn from the analyses was rather anticlimactic in that it showed no definitive proof of any long-term equator or poleward expansion of marine bivalve and gastropod genera throughout the Cenozoic.
