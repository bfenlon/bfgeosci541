##Summary
Analyses of modern extinction rates and how they compare to mass extinctions from the past are of great interest to conservation biologists and paleobiologists alike. Although only three of the 'Big Five' show significantly elevated extinction rates, for the purposes of this review all five are considered for their proportional biodiversity loss. There is a set of problems that come with studying modern extinctions, however. While we know roughly how many species are present on Earth today, there is likely some small fraction that we have yet to document. Additionally, less than three percent of known extant species have been evaluated for their inherent extinction risk at present. This all goes without saying that there may have been some species that went extinct that we simply never knew about. Putting these difficulties aside, the researchers decided to use a conservative paleontological definition of 75% or greater species loss (resulting from disparities in extinction and origination rates) to correspond to a mass extinction event.
