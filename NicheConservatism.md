### Summary
Extending previous studies of niche conservatism at the species level through utilization of geographic range data, the 
researchers looked at data surrounding the dramatic climate change due to warming in the late Pleistocene. When comparing 
niche conservatism at the species level to conservatism at the generic and family levels three things became obvious. The 
answer to their first proposed line of inquiry – to what extent did past climate change affect the extent of higher-level 
niches at the genus and family level – was intriguing. Species level niche expansion or reduction was prevalent, but when 
analyzing the aggregate species data for a genus, the geographic range size and ranks stayed relatively stable over 
130,000 years, regardless of dramatic climate change. Extinction at the genus level was seen only in monotypic genera, 
and for those that showed a larger-than-average change in rank (about a third of the genera) the body masses were uneven. 
Large mammals (>1000g) generally showed an increase in rank, with smaller mammals (≤1000g) showed a decrease in rank. The 
authors’ secondary goal in this piece was to investigate whether or not changes in niche-spaces at the species level would 
permeate up to higher-level hierarchical classifications. Conjointly with the initial conclusion that higher-level niches 
are resistant to climate change, the authors also investigated the degree to which shifts in ecological niche-spaces of 
species affected higher-level niche-spaces. To do this the authors looked at individual species extinctions and looked at 
the corresponding genera to determine if those deletions (in the LP warming) permeated to the higher levels by examining 
subsequent LH geographic range sizes in genera. They concluded that because ecological niche-spaces at the genus level 
were conserved, geographic range is an emergent property of genera (in mammals) and variations in species-level niche 
ranges are due more to intragenus competition, not the abiotic environment. Lastly, trait-based controls (i.e. dispersal 
ability, body size, population density, degree of specialization, etc.) on niche conservatism are more heavily weighted 
towards higher-level ecological niches. Although it was not explicitly tested in this paper, it would follow in a general 
sense that niche conservatism at the species level is affected more by immediate environmental-based controls (biotic/
abiotic interactions) than the aforementioned trait-based ones.

###Things you liked
Considering my field of choice in conservation biology, I found this article to be extremely interesting. Most importantly 
to me was the caveat presented by the authors in the discussion of the results. Although the ecological niches that were 
studied were conserved for more than a hundred millenia, many of them over the past hundred years have started to 
disappear. Inherent in this observation is the widespread and immense impact of human population growth. While this 
article was meant to provide a practical and historically relavent example for contemporary climate change effects on 
ecological niche-spaces, in actuality it only provides a semi-accurate forecast. Without preservation or conservation of 
existing ecological niches, whether that be at the species, genus, or family level, the applicability of this model to 
future climate change impacts on niche-spaces will continue to decline. More broadly, I find the suggestion that utilizing 
genus level modeling of niche conservatism would be more informative than species level ecological niche-space modeling 
when looking at the significance of climate change in mammal distribution to be quite interesting and something to be 
explored more closely. 

> I agree, it is a very intriguing idea that our conservation efforts might best be concerntrated at higher taxonomic levels.

###Things you did not like
Although any paper has to have a specific line of investigation to share a manageable amount of information with the reader, 
this one could have expounded on one thing. The authors mentioned at the outset that their study included only mammals. The 
reasoning for not including other animals and plants was that those groups are not monophyletic. While this rationale 
limited the scope of the paper to mammals, the reason as to why monophyly is an important characteristic was not expounded 
upon. If similar adaptations (trait-based) are important for determining niche-conservatism at the genus level, would this 
type of analysis not apply to para/polyphyletic genera that contain species with similar adaptations?

###Evaluation of figures
The figures in this article consisted mainly of before and after snapshots of both species level niche-spaces and genus level 
niche-spaces (for canis). Also included was a correlation of LP and LH range sizes, as well as a graphic, sorted by LP rank, 
depicting relative change in geographic range size for all included genera. All graphs and figures clearly distinguished 
between late Pleistocene and late Holocene time periods and, overall, were quite concise in presenting the necessary visual 
information for fully processing the hypotheses put forth in the body of the paper.
