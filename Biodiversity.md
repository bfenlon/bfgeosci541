##Summary
The final goal for this article was to present three different scenarios for biodiversity in the year 2100. In order to go about doing this, the researchers first identified five major determinants for global-scale biodiverity change in ten terrestrial biomes and freshwater ecosystems. These five drivers were changes in land use, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, nitrogen deposition and acid rain, climate, and biotic exchanges. Then, after calculating the expected change of these drivers over the next century
