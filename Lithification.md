##Summary
In this article, Hendy explores the ubiquitous problem of bias within the fossil record. More specifically he investigates the importance of lithification on the preservation of fossils, and the consequent paleontological interpretations. Before delving into the meat and potatoes of his methods, results, and conclusions a brief overview of alpha diversity is in order. This term refers to within community diversity, and many previous studies have utilized it as a proxy for aggregate biodiversity change from interval to interval. However, these other studies have failed to account for key biases in the fossil record such as ease of sampling from unlithified sediments, preservational biases, or sampling heterogeneities. The last bias (sampling heterogeneity) is often controlled for by using sample-standardization techniques such as rarefaction (number of species as a function of the number of samples), which is used in the analyses presented in this paper. Having touched on alpha diversity, let us dive in. The samples gathered for this study originate in the Wanganui and East Coast sedimentary basins of New Zealand, and consist of 169 samples across a range of lithification levels. These levels were classified as unlithified, poorly lithified, and lithified depending on individual specimens' ease of removal - or lack thereof - from the surrounding matrix. The collection, preparation, counting and identification were kept as constant as possible, but did vary somewhat from sample to sample due to the specific nature of sedimentation in that locality. For each sample multiple replicates were obtained, two to three hundred individual specimens were collected, and each was restricted to mollusc and brachiopod dominated transgressive shell beds to control for variations in time-averaging and environment.
