#Dinosaurs in decline tens of millions of years before their final extinction
###Manabu Sakamoto, Michael J. Benton, and Chris Venditti
#####Written by Bryce Fenlon

##Summary
The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event that occurred 66 million years ago traditionally marks the end of the nonavian dinosaurs. In this study, Sakamoto and others investigated the hypothesis that dinosaurs were actually in a slow decline leading up to the K-Pg. These two views - sudden or slow - have been hotly contested for a long time due to the pervasive use of nonphylogenetic, time-binned data. Further, past studies have failed, for the most part, to study speciation and extinction rates. Here the researchers take into account past statistical inconsistencies and use a generalized linear mixed model approach in a Bayesian framework to analyze the phylogenies of Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda.
