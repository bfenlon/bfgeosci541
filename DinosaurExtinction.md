#Dinosaurs in decline tens of millions of years before their final extinction

##Summary
The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event that occurred 66 million years ago traditionally marks the end of the nonavian dinosaurs. In this study, Sakamoto and others investigated the hypothesis that dinosaurs were actually in a slow decline leading up to the K-Pg. These two contrasting views - sudden or slow - have been hotly contested for a long time due to the pervasive use of nonphylogenetic, time-binned data. Further, previous studies have failed, for the most part, to study speciation and extinction rates. Here the researchers take into account past statistical inconsistencies and use a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach in a Bayesian framework to analyze the phylogenies of Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda. In essence, a GLMM is an extension of logistic regression that accounts for both fixed and random effects. By using it in a Bayesian framework, the researchers allow for the use of prior and posterior distributions for both of these effects when inferring probabilities. A similar but more widely used type would be an ARMA (autoregressive moving average) model used for time series analysis. Putting all of this together and using it on phylogenies means that temporal and phylogenetic nonindependence can be taken into account, something that past studies have failed to do. It also follows that speciation and extinction dynamics play an integral role in this type of statistical modeling. 

The results that the researchers produced were consistent across all three phylogenies when Hadrosauriformes and Ceratopsidae were considered separate from Ornithischia. These two subclades show no speciation slowdown or downturn towards the End Cretaceous, and their dynamics were modeled using inset graphs. The Dinosauria model predicts a downturn closer to the K-Pg event than those for the three subclades; 24 My before as opposed to 48-53 My before. Discrepencies in slowdown and downturn between the Dinosauria model and those for the three major subclades studied here can be explained by nonhomogeneity in speciation dynamics (i.e Hadrosauriformes and Ceratopsidae). Theropods displayed slowly increasing speciation from ~215 Mya to ~120 Mya where it began to wind down and decrease, with a similar pattern displayed by Theropoda from ~192 to ~114 Mya. Sauropodomorpha speciation rate throughout the Early Mesozoic was nearly twice that of Theropoda and Ornithischia, and the results show a downturn at ~114 Mya. In all cases the data was better explained by a quadratic rather than a linear model when analyzing the log node count of the phylogenetic trees.
