#The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction
###Payne, J.L., and Finnegan, S. (2007)
#####Written by Bryce Fenlon

##Summary
logistic regression --> odds ratio (log-odds; odds of an outcome and its explanatory variable) --> 0 = absence of association; greater than or less than zero = positive/inverse associations between outcome and explanatory variable.

geographic range positively correlated with survivorship throughout fossil record (significantly in 44 of 47 examined intervals)

multiple logistic regression in order to determine effect of geographic range on survivorship, independent of species richness and number of occurrences worldwide
