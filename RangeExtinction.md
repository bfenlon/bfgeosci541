##Summary
logistic regression because binary, not continuous --> odds ratio (log-odds; odds of an outcome and its explanatory variable) --> 0 = absence of association; greater than or less than zero = positive/inverse associations between outcome and explanatory variable.

geographic range positively correlated with survivorship throughout fossil record (significantly in 44 of 47 examined intervals)

multiple logistic regression in order to determine effect of geographic range on survivorship, independent of species richness and number of occurrences worldwide
  - found that geographic range selectivity in data is more consistent with extinction data than either of the other two
  - suggests the association of richness/number of occurrences w/ extinction risk in single regressions partially reflect a          geographic range correlation

Because the researchers investigated different extinction risks amongst varying range sizes *within* 10 Myr intervals, instead of *between* them, sampling heterogeneities play less of a role.
  - Genera in well sampled intervals tend to have larger absolute ranges than less well sampled intervals
